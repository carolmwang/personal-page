            <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faQuoteLeft} /> I am a driven web developer continuously looking for a challenge. Nothing satisfies me more than identifying and debugging code, 
            letâ€™s leave the bugs for the entomologists. My background in analytics has created a foundation for my meticulous, problem solving skills, and above all, a passion for structuring data. 
            I have experience with both front and back-end techniques and enjoy the challenges presented by either side. 
            Web development has taught me perseverance through understanding that failure is the first stop on the road to success.   <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faQuoteRight} />
